            <h2>What is the Metaverse?</h3>
            <div id="paragraph">The metaverse is an immersive, digital alternative to the physical world, where virtual avatars come together to work, pursue hobbies, shop, play, or otherwise gather to engage in online communities and explore the digital space. <br><br>In theory, we'll be able to move from one virtual world to another in the metaverse, but we'll be wearing virtual reality goggles or maybe augmented reality

            <h3>The Metaverse in practice</h3>
            <div id="paragraph">While the excitement around the concept of a metaverse is rapidly growing, bringing that vision to reality is still many years away. <br><br> The possibilities of a virtual world, where everything is supported by lines of codes, could open new revenue streams for companies diving into this new venture. The opportunities are limitless, and based on how people have adopted an increasingly digital life, the change is already taking place. Walmart has announced that it would step into the virtual world, providing currency and allowing customers to buy and sell NFTs.
            <br><br>With the speed at which technologies are being developed and companies are implementing innovative ideas around immersive reality, it's only a matter of time before the metaverse becomes a reality.
            <br><br>The experience of the web will be completely different compared to what it is now.
