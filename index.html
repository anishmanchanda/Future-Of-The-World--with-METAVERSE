            <h3>What is the Metaverse?</h3>
            <div id="paragraph">The metaverse is an immersive, digital alternative to the physical world, where virtual avatars come together to work, pursue hobbies, shop, play, or otherwise gather to engage in online communities and explore the digital space. <br><br>In theory, we'll be able to move from one virtual world to another in the metaverse, but we'll be wearing virtual reality goggles or maybe augmented reality

            <div id="paragraph">This year we will see the metaverse become more concrete, as it pushes to prove its promised potential.</div>
            
            <h3>The Metaverse in practice</h3>
            <div id="paragraph">While the excitement around the concept of a metaverse is rapidly growing, bringing that vision to reality is still many years away. 
            <br><br> The possibilities of a virtual world, where everything is supported by lines of codes, could open new revenue streams for companies diving into this new venture. The opportunities are limitless, and based on how people have adopted an increasingly digital life, the change is already taking place. Walmart has announced that it would step into the virtual world, providing currency and allowing customers to buy and sell NFTs.
            <br><br>With the speed at which technologies are being developed and companies are implementing innovative ideas around immersive reality, it's only a matter of 3 years before the metaverse becomes a reality according to Bill Gates.</div>

            <div id="paragraph">School and social life, too, will evolve. Roblox, for instance, is planning to bring educational videogames to classrooms. Platforms such as AltspaceVR enable community-based experiences in the metaverse, allowing people to gather for live virtual events, such as comedy clubs or bar nights. Roblox sees itself as a future hub for metaverse experiences beyond games, such as concerts.
            <br><br>A new era for commerce may dawn, with stores selling anything from fantastical digital pets to e-pparel. Fortnite has long capitalized on digital skins, and more traditional retailers are following suit. Nike has filed trademarks for virtual gear, shoes and accessories, and luxury labels Gucci, Balenciaga and Luis Vuitton are beginning to sell e-clothes and e-bags. You could also buy a $650,000 digital yacht or NFT art for your immersive mansion. Meta-malls are starting to pop up, allowing you to shop in VR stores and stock up on outfits for your avatar.    
            <br><br>The experience of the web will be completely different compared to what it is now.
